# Mario PSPACE-Hardness Gadgets

This repository is a collection of ips patches and level files
so you can play the gadgets (pieces of levels) in our proofs that
various Super Mario Bros. platforming games are computationally intractable.
They were developed during
[MIT's 6.5440 class in Fall 2023](https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.5440/fall23/)
and subsequently appear in our two papers:

* Super Mario Bros. 3, Super Mario Land 2, and Super Mario World door gadgets

* New Super Mario Bros. Wii counter machine, showing RE-completeness of a constant-size level in the game

## IPS Patches

For Super Mario Bros. 3, Super Mario Land 2, and Super Mario World, we provide IPS files which can be patched to an unmodified ROM using a utility like [Floating IPS](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/1040/).

## New Super Mario Bros. Wii

These are level files which can be added to a complete New Super Mario Bros. Wii filestructure to create a playable ROM.
