# Mario Hardness Gadgets

This repository is a collection of ips patches and level files
so you can play the gadgets (pieces of levels) in our proofs that
various Super Mario Bros. platforming games are computationally intractable.
They were developed during
[MIT's 6.5440 class in Fall 2023](https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.5440/fall23/)
and subsequently appear in our two papers:

## PSPACE-Hardness

For Super Mario Bros. 3, Super Mario Land 2, and Super Mario World,
we build door gadgets which prove
[PSPACE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSPACE)-hardness.

## Undecidability / RE-completeness

For New Super Mario Bros. Wii, we build a counter machine,
proving RE-completeness of a constant-size level in the game.

## Formats

### IPS Patches

For Super Mario Bros. 3, Super Mario Land 2, and Super Mario World, we provide IPS files which can be patched to an unmodified ROM using a utility like [Floating IPS](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/1040/).

### Level Files

For New Super Mario Bros. Wii,
we provide level files which can be added to a complete New Super Mario Bros. Wii filestructure to create a playable ROM.
