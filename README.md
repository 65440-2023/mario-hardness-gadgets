# Mario PSPACE-Hardness Gadgets

This repository is a collection of ips patches and level files
so you can play the gadgets (pieces of levels) in our proofs that
various Super Mario Bros. platforming games are
[PSPACE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSPACE)-hard.
They were developed during MIT's
[6.5440 class in Fall 2023](https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.5440/fall23/),
and subsequently appear in our paper:

> "PSPACE-Hard 2D Super Mario Games: Thirteen Doors"\

## IPS Patches

For Super Mario Bros. 3, Super Mario Land 2, and Super Mario World, we provide IPS files which can be patched to an unmodified ROM using a utility like [Floating IPS](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/1040/).

## New Super Mario Bros. Wii

This is a level file which can be added to a complete New Super Mario Bros. Wii filestructure to create a playable ROM.
